# Churn Prediction Model

## Overview

This project aims to develop a churn prediction model using machine learning techniques. The provided Jupyter Notebook, `churn_prediction.ipynb`, walks through the entire process of building, training, and evaluating the churn prediction model. The model is designed to predict customer churn, which is a critical aspect for businesses to proactively address and retain valuable customers.

## Introduction

Customer churn is a significant concern for businesses, and predicting potential churners can help in implementing targeted retention strategies. This project explores a machine learning approach to predict customer churn based on historical data.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluating the model is included in the repository as `dataset.csv`. It contains relevant features and the target variable indicating whether a customer has churned or not.

## Installation

To run the Jupyter Notebook, ensure you have Python installed along with the required dependencies. You can install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/harshvardhan2804/churn-prediction-model.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd churn-prediction-model
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook churn_prediction.ipynb
   ```

   Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the code cells and understand the workflow.

## Model Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using relevant metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The results and insights are discussed within the Jupyter Notebook.
